5. Read `Assignments.md` carefully for instructions and create your solutions in `src` directory.
6. Create a branch for each exercise. You will merge your work (Pull Request) into main after each exercise is complete and tested. For example: `dev-dt-ex1`
7. 1 partner creates a PR after each exercise.
- Requires approval and checking for merge conflicts.
- Only after this, move to the next exercise where the Partner making the PR is switched.
